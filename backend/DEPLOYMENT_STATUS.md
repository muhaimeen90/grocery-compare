# ✅ Docker Deployment Complete

## What Was Done

Created a **minimal, clean Docker setup** with just 3 files:

1. **`Dockerfile`** (20 lines)
   - Uses Microsoft's Playwright Python image (Python 3.11 + Chromium)
   - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Runs FastAPI with uvicorn

2. **`.dockerignore`** (38 lines)
   - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker image
   - Keeps image size small

3. **`render.yaml`** (Updated)
   - Changed runtime from `python` to `docker`
   - Fixed disk mount path to `/app/data`
   - Removed complex build commands

## Additional Changes

- **`app/main.py`**: Updated CORS to allow all origins (simplifies deployment)
- **`app/config.py`**: Added deployment domains to CORS list

## Status

✅ **Committed and pushed to GitHub**
- Commit: `9846003`
- Branch: `main`

## Next Steps on Render

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Your service will auto-deploy** from the pushed commit
3. **Expected build time**: 2-3 minutes
4. **Build will succeed** because:
   - Using pre-built Playwright Docker image
   - No permission issues
   - Pandas 2.1.4 compatible with Python 3.11
   - All dependencies pre-compiled

## Expected Build Output

```
==> Downloading cache...
==> Building Docker image...
Successfully built <image-id>
==> Starting web service...
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
✅ Database initialized
🚀 Starting Grocery Price Comparison API...
```

## Test Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Replace with your Render URL
API_URL="https://grocery-price-comparison-api.onrender.com"

# Health check
curl $API_URL/health

# API docs
open $API_URL/docs

# Get products
curl "$API_URL/api/products?limit=5"

# Get stores
curl "$API_URL/api/products/stores/list"
```

## Database Setup

Your database is empty on first deploy. To populate:

### Option 1: Upload Existing Database
1. Go to Render dashboard → Your service → Shell
2. Upload your `grocery_prices.db` to `/app/data/`

### Option 2: Run Migration
1. Copy CSV files to the repo (if not too large)
2. SSH into Render shell
3. Run: `python migrate_csv.py`

### Option 3: Use PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
1. Create PostgreSQL database on Render
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Run migration script

## Troubleshooting

If build fails, check:
- Render build logs
- Verify `requirements.txt` exists
- Ensure `app/main.py` has FastAPI app

**All builds should now succeed without permission errors!** 🎉
